# ParaQuaSeq Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zoosporic Parasite repository. This database is a part of a larger, innovative project aimed at addressing the significant impact of zoosporic parasites on both natural ecosystems and the microalgae biotech industry. Zoosporic parasites, which include fungi and fungi-like aquatic microorganisms, are crucial drivers of natural populations and can cause severe host mortality. Their economic impacts are particularly notable in the microalgae biotech industry, affecting the production of food ingredients, biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals.

## Aims of ParAqua:
* Integration and Collaboration: Establish a dynamic European network that connects scientists, industries, and stakeholders. This network aims to optimize information exchange, equalize access to resources, and develop a joint research agenda.
* Information Compilation: Compile and make available comprehensive information on the occurrence of zoosporic parasites and their relationships with hosts.
* Impact Assessment: Elucidate the drivers and evaluate the impacts of parasitism in both natural and man-made aquatic environments.
* Tool Development: Implement new tools for monitoring and preventing infections, and create protocols and a Decision Support Tool for detecting and controlling parasites in the microalgae biotech industry.
* Applied Knowledge: Explore whether the developed tools can be applied for monitoring lakes and reservoirs, feeding back industry knowledge to ecological research.
* Education and Training: Organize Short-Term Scientific Missions and Training Schools for early-stage scientists and managers, with a specific focus on inclusivity and integration of both scientific and applied expertise.

## Database Objective
The specific objective of this database (D1.WG3) within the ParAqua project is to compile and integrate a searchable database on zoosporic parasites across Europe. This database aims to:

* Catalogue Expertise: Identify and catalogue available expertise based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey.
* Inventory Parasite Effects: Document and analyze the effects of zoosporic parasites on algal hosts in both natural and biotechnological contexts.
